# Resources-for-learning
A repository where I keep learning resources address. You are invited to check them out to improve your technical skills as a developer.

## From the course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" taught by Dr. Angela Lu

### For responsiveness using Media Quieries
- Mobile Devices: 319px - 480px
- iPads and Tablets: 482px - 1200px
- Laptops: 1201px - 1600px
- Desktops: 1601px and more.

### For learning Flex-box
- <a href = "https://appbrewery.github.io/flexboxfroggy/" style="text-decoration:none;"> Flex box froggy game </a>

### For learning Grid-box
- <a href = "https://appbrewery.github.io/gridgarden/" style="text-decoration:none;"> Grid Garden Game </a>

### For minifying code
- <a href = "https://www.minifier.org/"> Minify your code </a>
- Minifing means reducing the size of your code through space and comment removal.

### Short Notes
- Higher order functions are functions that can take other functions as inputs.
- Node is not a JavaScript framework, rather Node is a runtime environment. Node allows us to run JS on a computer and not just limited on the computer.


### Fun
- Would like to have fun with the fake hacker typer? then checkout <a href = "https://hackertyper.com/"> hackertyper </a>

### Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous
- Visit the <a href = "https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial"> learn enough </a> website

### Common words and Abbrevations

- CDN stands for Content Distribution Network. I have discovered this when learning BootStrap.
- Vanilla language = Pure language without any external libraries and frameworks
  Example: Vanilla CSS = Pure CSS without bootstrap or tailwind css and soon.
- NPM = Node Package Manager
- CJS = Common JavaScript
- ESM = ECMAScript Modules
- EJS = Embedded JavaScript
- JSON = JavaScript Object Notation. This is basically a configuration file.

### HTTP return codes cheat sheet
- GET => Request resource.
- POST => Sending resource.
- PUT => Update by replacing resource.
- PATCH => Update by patching up a resource.
- DELETE => Deleting a resource.
- 1 => Hold on
- 2 => Here you go
- 3 => Go away
- 4 => You (the user) screwed up 
- 5 => I (the server) screwed up

### Version control using git and GitHub

Steps to using the command line to commit on a github repository.
#### Creating Local Repostitory


      1. git init 
      2. git add example1.example1 example2.example2
      3. git commit -m "Your commit message here"
      - git status --> to check the status 
      - git log --> to get information about recent commits made.
      - git diff filename --> check the difference of a file from the original version
      - git checkout filename --> rollback a file to it's last version

  #### Creating Remote Repostirory (On Github or others)
      1. git remote add origin github_repository_url
      2. git branch -M main --> Change the deafult branch to main ( the code is going to be pushed here)
      3. git push -u origin main --> Push the code

### APIs
- https://www.bored-api.appbrewery.com/endpoint?query=value&query2=value2. bored-api.appbrewery.com ---> base URL   endpoint ---> endpoint  ?query=value&query2=value2 ---> query

### JSON
- To see a humanoid version of JSON ---> jsonviewer.stack.hu
- A password decoding website ---> base64decode.org
- JSON visualizer --> <a href = "https://jsonviewer.stack.hu/">jsonviewer.stack.hu</a>

### Angular
- Angular supports MVC architecture. MVC architecture allows developers to separate thier code into 3 distinct parts, namely Model, View and Controller.

### GitHub


  



### Expree
- "/" --> root route.
