### Version control using git and GitHub

Steps to using the command line to commit on a github repository.
      - git init 
      - git add file_to_be_added
      - git commit -m "Commit_message"
      - git status --> to check the status 
      - git log --> to get information about recent commits made.
      - git diff filename --> check the difference of a file from the original version
      - git checkout filename --> rollback a file to it's last version
